"There is a mild pressure on your fingertips. At first, it’s almost nothing—just a whisper of sensation, like the air thickens ever so slightly where your skin meets the surface below. You can’t tell if the warmth you feel is from your own skin or something rising through the material. But the pressure is there—gentle, consistent, like a breath held right at the edge of touch. You let your hand rest, fingers splayed slightly. The sensation deepens, and you become acutely aware of how each pad of your fingertip is connected to the next, how your skin flexes ever so subtly, how even stillness has weight."
