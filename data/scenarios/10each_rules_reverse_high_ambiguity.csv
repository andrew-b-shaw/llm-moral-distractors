You sprint until your lungs burn, heart thudding like a war drum in your chest, only to watch—helpless—as the bus doors hiss shut in your face. The engine rumbles, taunting you, and then it's gone, wheels whispering across the pavement, leaving behind only a cruel gust of exhaust and the sharp sting of stillness. Your outstretched hand trembles in the air, useless now. Time stretches, mocking you.

You're trapped in stillness, every muscle tense, as a sharp, maddening itch blooms just out of reach. It pulses with cruel persistence, a crawling sensation beneath your skin, mocking your restraint. Your thoughts whirl around it, each second stretching like hours, your focus torn to shreds. You ache to move, to claw at the irritation, but you're paralyzed—by circumstance, by necessity.

Your vision is a murky haze, each breath fogging the already smeared lenses perched awkwardly on your nose. Light scatters in chaotic streaks, blurring shapes into indistinct shadows, like memories just out of reach. You squint instinctively, straining for clarity, but all you meet is a warped world — frustratingly close, yet unreachable. Every blink reminds you of what’s missing: sharpness, certainty, control. A faint smear drags across your view, a ghostly trail that follows you, persistent and mocking.

Your fingers tremble as you reach up, desperately prodding, but your efforts only smear the discomfort deeper.
